4. Subtle Differences to Keep in Mind

Think vs. Believe:

  “Think” = reasoned opinion (“I think it will rain”).

  “Believe” = trust or faith (“I believe him”).

Assume vs. Suppose:

  “Assume” = take something for granted, often without evidence.

  “Suppose” = a milder conjecture, often more polite or hypothetical.

Realize vs. Notice:

  “Notice” = observe something.

  “Realize” = suddenly understand or become aware.

Trust vs. Believe:

  “Trust” = confidence in reliability or integrity.

  “Believe” = acceptance of truth or existence, not necessarily reliability.
